\## 1. Status
Status: **Accepted**
Date: 2025-12-16

\## 2. Context
The application targets French users. French typography requires specific rules (non-breaking spaces before punctuation, typographic quotes `« »`) that are often missed in standard input.

\## 3. Decision
We will implement a central utility `formatFrenchTypography` applied via pipes or directives to automatically correct spacing and punctuation in the UI.

\## 4. Consequences
\### Good
* Consistent professional appearance complying with Imprimerie Nationale rules.
\### Bad
* Runtime string processing overhead (minimal).
