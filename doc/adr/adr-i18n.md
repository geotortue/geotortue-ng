# ADR - i18n

The i18n's management is divided into two parts:

- the user interface (UI)
- the instruction language (DSL)

A translation in each managed language will be available for all text that may be presented to the user, whether UI or DSL, including the user documentation.

Everything else (console messages, code comments, technical documentation, etc.) will be provided only in English.

See [ADR Typographie](./adr-004-typography.md%20).
